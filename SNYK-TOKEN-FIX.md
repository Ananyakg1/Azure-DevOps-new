# üîç Snyk Token Validation Guide

## Current Issue: Valid Token, Authentication Failed

Your workflow shows that the `SNYK_TOKEN` secret exists but Snyk is rejecting it with error `SNYK-0005`.

### üîß **Immediate Solutions**

#### Option 1: Get a New Token
1. Go to [snyk.io](https://snyk.io)
2. Log in to your account
3. Navigate to **Settings** ‚Üí **General** ‚Üí **API Token**
4. **Revoke** the old token
5. **Generate** a new token
6. **Copy** the new token
7. **Update** the GitHub secret `SNYK_TOKEN` with the new value

#### Option 2: Verify Token Format
Your token should look like: `xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx`
- Must be a valid UUID format
- No extra spaces or characters
- No quotes around the token

#### Option 3: Check Account Status
- Ensure your Snyk account is active
- Verify you have API access permissions
- Check if you're using the correct Snyk organization

### üöÄ **Quick Fix: Disable Snyk Temporarily**

If you want to test the pipeline without Snyk authentication issues:

1. **Modify the workflow** to skip Snyk steps:
   ```yaml
   - name: Authenticate with Snyk
     if: false  # This will skip the step
     run: |
       # ... snyk auth steps
   ```

2. **Or set continue-on-error** (already configured):
   The workflow will continue even if Snyk fails.

### üõ†Ô∏è **Alternative Security Scanning**

Since Snyk is causing issues, let's add alternative security tools that don't require authentication:

#### Safety (Python dependency scanner):
```yaml
- name: Run Safety security scan
  run: |
    pip install safety
    safety check --file requirements.txt
  continue-on-error: true
```

#### Bandit (Python code security):
```yaml
- name: Run Bandit security scan
  run: |
    pip install bandit
    bandit -r . -f json
  continue-on-error: true
```

#### Trivy (Container security):
```yaml
- name: Run Trivy vulnerability scanner
  uses: aquasecurity/trivy-action@master
  with:
    image-ref: ${{ env.IMAGE_NAME }}:${{ github.sha }}
    format: 'table'
```

### üîÑ **Test Your Token Manually**

To verify your token works:

1. **Install Snyk CLI locally**:
   ```bash
   npm install -g snyk
   ```

2. **Test authentication**:
   ```bash
   snyk auth YOUR_TOKEN_HERE
   ```

3. **Test a scan**:
   ```bash
   snyk test --file=requirements.txt
   ```

If this fails locally, the token definitely needs to be regenerated.

### üìù **Updated Workflow Recommendation**

Let me create a version that's more resilient to Snyk issues.
